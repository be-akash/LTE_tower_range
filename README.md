# Tower Mapping Project with ASP.NET and Vue.js

## Overview

Welcome to our Tower Mapping Project, a simple and efficient solution for visualizing tower data using ASP.NET and Vue.js. This project combines the robust backend capabilities of ASP.NET with the dynamic frontend features of Vue.js, along with Leaflet for mapping and OpenStreetMap (OSM) for accurate geospatial data.

## Features

1. **ASP.NET Integration:**
   - Solid backend infrastructure for data management and server-side operations.

2. **Vue.js for User Interface:**
   - Dynamic and responsive user interface for seamless interaction with tower data.

3. **Leaflet Mapping:**
   - Integration of Leaflet for creating interactive and visually appealing maps.

4. **OpenStreetMap (OSM) Base:**
   - Utilization of OSM as the base mapping layer for accurate geographical information.

5. **User-Friendly Design:**
   - Intuitive interface for easy navigation and interaction with tower data.

6. **Real-time Updates:**
   - Implementation of real-time data updates for the latest and most relevant information.

7. **Customizable Visuals:**
   - Personalization of the map with customizable markers and popups for easy identification.

8. **Responsive Design:**
   - Optimized experience on both desktop and mobile devices with responsive design.
